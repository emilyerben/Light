# Light


Light will be a project subdivided in three main sections corresponding to the fields 
1. Neuroscience combined with AI (code name: BrainX)
2. Nanotechnology (code name: Cynapse) <p>
and
3. Brain Networktechnology (code name: Matrix)
 

# Very Short Introduction <p>
  Light is intended as a privacy maintaining decentralized organization for brain-to-machine and brain-to-brain communication, counteracting the thread of Neurological Disorders, Artificial Intelligence and Death. We are looking forward to developing hardware and software, which can ultimately interact with the entire brain.

# Tangle
The Tangle is a directed acyclic graph specified in the IOTA-Foundations white paper http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf by Serguei Popov. It represents a contrasting multidimensional approach to the one-dimensional blockchain technology. The Tangle technology provides for a network in which each user has to confirm two parent transactions (tips) in order to make a transaction. Thus, the proof-of-work divided among miners does no longer exist. This also has the advantage of requiring less computing power and thereby eliminating the increasing environmental pollution from mining. While for Bitcoin, processing power steadily needs to increase and miners need to store a steadily growing amount of blockchain data, making Bitcoin increasingly unstable with growing user traffic, the Tangle is becoming increasingly secure as user numbers increase. The more transactions are processed, the more transactions are confirmed, the faster the network and the safer these transactions become. In addition, there are no fees, the Tangle is quantum-resistant, provides for offline transactions, has better protection against sybil- or other attacks and prevents storage overflow by snapshotting the network once in a while.

The Tangle, for all its advantages over other cryptocurrencies, shell become the basis of Light's Matrix network. The Tangle is a connection to the Internet of Everything. As long as a device is connected to the Tangle and confers the right to access it, anyone could telepathically control the device through the Matrix network. Light will work with many companies to ensure secure access to some features of their devices. Especially anonymity in the Matrix is important for Light, which is why the Tangles security will be coplemented by the Pro. The Tangle furthermore provides Flash Channels and MAMs, which allow for a particularly fast exchange of data.

# IoE
The Internet of Everything is slightly different from the Internet of Things, because it not only attempts to connect machines, but to connect humans and processes with machines. IOTA will enable the economy of things, whereas Light will play its part in connecting this economy of things to a economy of humans and real idenities. The Tangle is a door for Light to the Internet of Things and therefore to the IoE. To date there are a few but very ambitious partnerships and connections between the IOTA Foundation and mainstream companies (e.g. Volkswagen, Fujitsu, Bosch, BMW, Schindler Group, the UN, InnoEnergy, Kontakt.io, Ford, General Motors, IBM, SAP, Daimler, Phillips, Samsung, Microsoft, Porsche or Telekom). If products of these companies supported the Tangle, Light would also be able to access the products and thus could focus on other projects or help the IOTA Foundation with gaining partnerships. 

# Cynapse
Cynapse will develop the hardware for its network und software.

Cynapse is supposed to be the foundation for an error-free interaction between the human brain and the internet of everything. Cynapse will do research on Brain Machine Interfaces, which will use nanoparticles to increase the precision of mind reading. Light has an important decision to make regarding the moral viability of invasive methods that can analyze and interact with the brain. Currently, brain-computer interfaces are often used non-invasively, but as networking progresses, integrating technology into our brains will become inevitable. Therefore, Light will use highly invasive yet biologically safe nanoparticles to operate in the brain. Important functions for such nanoparticles are a harmless injection, interaction between brain and technology, an adequate energy supply, and signal transmission to a computer unit. So far there are few distriptions of micro- or nanotechnological brain-machine-interfaces and almost none for business purposes.

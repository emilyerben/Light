# Light


Light will be a project subdivided in three main sections corresponding to the fields <p>
1. Neuroscience combined with Machine Learning (Link) --> The Software <p>
2. Nanotechnology combined with Microbiology (Cynapse) --> The Hardware <p>
3. Networktechnology combined with Distributed Ledger Technology (Matrix) --> The Network
 

# Abstract <p>
  Light is intended as a privacy maintaining decentralized organization for brain-to-machine and brain-to-brain communication, counteracting the thread of Neurological Disorders, Artificial Intelligence and Death. We are looking forward to developing hardware and software, which can ultimately interact with the entire brain.

# Tangle
The Tangle is a directed acyclic graph specified in the IOTA-Foundations white paper http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf by Serguei Popov. It represents a contrasting multidimensional approach to the one-dimensional blockchain technology. The Tangle technology provides a network in which each user has to confirm two parent transactions (tips) in order to make a transaction. Thus, the proof-of-work divided among miners does no longer exist. This also has the advantage of requiring less computing power and thereby eliminating the increasing environmental pollution from mining. While for Bitcoin, processing power steadily needs to increase and miners need to store a steadily growing amount of blockchain data, making Bitcoin increasingly unstable with growing user traffic, the Tangle is becoming increasingly secure as user numbers increase. The more transactions are processed, the more transactions are confirmed, the faster the network and the safer these transactions become. In addition, there are no fees, the Tangle is quantum-resistant, provides for offline transactions, has better protection against sybil- or other attacks and prevents storage overflow by snapshotting the network once in a while.

The Tangle, for all its advantages over other cryptocurrencies, shall become the basis of Light's Matrix network. The Tangle is a connection to the Internet of Everything. As long as a device is connected to the Tangle and confers the right to access it, anyone could telepathically control the device through the Matrix network. Light will work with many companies to ensure secure access to some features of their devices. Especially anonymity in the Matrix is important for Light, which is why the Tangles security will be complemented by the Pro. The Tangle furthermore provides Flash Channels and MAMs, which allow for a particularly fast exchange of data.

# IoE
The Internet of Everything is slightly different from the Internet of Things, because it not only attempts to connect machines, but to connect humans and processes with machines. IOTA will enable the economy of things, whereas Light will play its part in connecting this economy of things to an economy of humans and real idenities. The Tangle is a door for Light to the Internet of Things and therefore to the IoE. To date there are a few but very ambitious partnerships and connections between the IOTA Foundation and mainstream companies/organizations (e.g. Volkswagen, Fujitsu, Bosch, BMW, Schindler Group, the UN, InnoEnergy, Kontakt.io, Ford, General Motors, IBM, SAP, Daimler, Phillips, Samsung, Microsoft, Porsche or Telekom). If products of these companies supported the Tangle, Light would also be able to access the products and thus could focus on other projects or help the IOTA Foundation with gaining partnerships. 

# Cynapse
Cynapse will develop the hardware for its network and software.

Cynapse is supposed to be the foundation for an error-free interaction between the human brain and the Internet of Everything. Cynapse will do research on Brain-Machine-Interfaces, which will use nanoparticles to increase the precision of neuroimaging. Light has an important decision to make regarding the moral viability of invasive methods that can analyze and interact with the brain. Currently, Brain-Computer-Interfaces are often used non-invasively, but as networking progresses, integrating technology into our brains will become inevitable. Therefore, Light will use highly invasive yet biologically safe nanoparticles to operate in the brain. Important functions for such nanoparticles are a harmless injection, precise interaction between brain and technology, an adequate energy supply, and signal transmission to a computer unit. So far there are few discriptions of micro- or nanotechnological Brain-Machine-Interfaces and almost none for business purposes.

# Flash Channels

![](https://github.com/LksWlprn/Light/blob/master/Matrix/1_cj7Wp8szGC1pD_jDSlcXQA.png)

Flash channels are channels created between two parties in the network. These are established apart from the rest of the network and can now communicate or send money offline. Since no PoW must be provided within the Flash Channels, transactions can be sent at the speed of light. This is especially important for Light, as large amounts of data must be transferred in a very short time, as soon as two people or one person and one AI are talking to each other via thoughts. It might be difficult to imagine the use of Flash Channels if more than two people want to communicate. But since the Tangle is free of charge, eliminating routing, instead, one can open multiple Flash Channels simultaneously, creating a network between multiple communication partners. At the end of each communication, one would join the network again to save the transferred money on the Tangle.

# Link
Based on HTM theory (https://numenta.com/, https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/biological-and-machine-intelligence/BAMI-Complete.pdf) and other neurobiological models of the neocortex, Link will be a project that brings together Neurobiology, Distributed Ledger Technology and Machine Learning. The key technology of Link will be the Pro (Pattern Recognition Organizer), which will store decentralized identities and decrypt and encrypt thoughts.

# BMI
BMIs are nothing new and don't really need a detailed explanation. Companies that follow similar paths to Lights are for example Neuralink https://www.neuralink.com/, <p>
Kernel https://kernel.co/ <p>
or Synchron https://www.synchronmed.com/.

# Qubic
In 2012, under the message of Come-from-Beyond on a project called Qubic, a forum was created that allowed some insights into the structure of this speculative project. After the end of the forum, for many years there was no more accurate information about Qubic, but in 2018 the mystical Project Q was due to be released. Already after initial information on Qubic was available in May 2018, one could not overlook its brilliance and potential range of influence. In 2012, Qubic was merely an approach to a system that has been expanded to this day. It was already confirmed in May by the founders that it would enable Smart Contracts, Oracle and outsourced computing, which has many benefits for Light. For a decentralized network that wants to enable a virtual reality and an exchange of thoughts, smart contracts are extremely important. But Oracles could offer even greater potential. They connect APIs and thus the regular Internet with the decentralized system of Tangles. Oracles can therefore also allow access to many systems on the Internet for Light. The biggest potential, however, is outsourced computing. Decentralized outsourced computing could enable outsourcing of thoughts and thus the merging of intelligences. In addition, a computer in use today may not be able to handle all the thought streams of a NanoBMI on its own and thus may require computing power from other computers or devices. This is a possible approach and concept for the Pro.

# NanoBMI
This will be discussed in-depth in Lights white paper on this topic. 
(Will probably be published in 2 to 3 years)

# MAM

![](https://github.com/LksWlprn/Light/blob/master/Matrix/1_vxWwHUvl6fdg39F0mGxkkQ.png)

IOTA uses a Gossip protocol for sending Masked Authenticated Messages (MAMs) that sends encrypted messages to the Tangle. There, certain nodes receive the message and gossip it to other nodes. If you send messages in the so-called private mode, as long as a node does not know the root, i.e. the channel ID and the hash of the message, it can not read the message. If you are in restrictive mode, only nodes with a sidekey can access your data. So the Tangle allows for secure data transfer that Light will use, to send and store thoughts as well as information about a userâ€™s brain, which is needed for the PoUI. However, one must consider the principle of immutability of these messages. Even IPFS has the problem that files, once stored on its network, can not be removed from the Blockchain again. IOTA does not have this attribute to the same extent because so-called snapshotting and, in this very case, local snapshots can delete the messages again. On a high level, a snapshot of the Tangle aggregates all the transactions of a node into a single transaction, greatly reducing the amount of data on the entire Tangle. The MAMs that are sent before the snapshot disappear with it, which is even relatively positive for Light, because thoughts should not necessarily be stored eternally. Some thoughts might still be saved forever. All one needs is a connection to a Permanode, which still allows to capture data as long as possible. In the future, snapshots could be done locally, whereas today they affect the entire Tangle. Therefore, all messages can be deleted immediately after a call in the local Tangle, which would also be a positive feature.

# Pro

![](https://github.com/LksWlprn/Light/blob/master/Link/Pro/Matrix%20Protocol.png) <p>
 
The most important technology within the project Link is called the Pro, emerged from the acronym PRO for Pattern Recognition Organizer. The Pro is the most complex software that Light has to develop in its early days. The Pro is split into two parts: the Offline-Pro and the Online-Pro. Both are relatively complex technologies, wherefore so far only approaches exist on how they can be implemented. Particular attention is paid to the privacy, security and speed of data processing. 
The Offline-Pro will store an encrypted key, which is only known by the Brain-Machine-Interface. In addition, a BMI may allow for different keys depending on its design. In the case of NanoBMIs from Light, even one key for every nanoparticle could be possible. If the login is successful, the Online-Pro must be selected to decrypt the identity. Matrix nodes can now compare and match the identity of the real user with a decentralized stored identity to prove a real unique identity. Since every person has to have a brain to log in to the Pro, no identity without a brain and therefore no fake identity can process thoughts on the network. 

A short high level overview: The Pro needs some abilities to decrypt thoughts. It must be able to recognize a person with very high reliability and must find out very quickly the interplay of neurons and what it means. This requires nanoparticles that can analyze the properties of their neurons and dendrites. They have to recognize by their own receptors whether neurons in their environment send inhibitory or excitatory signals, in which layer they are located and generally where in the neocortex they are. With information about the location of a nanoparticle, the speed of signal sequences, or the interrelationships between patterns, the Pro must be able to recognize thoughts and increase precision by using the input regions and all the data at their disposal. Another feature of the Pro must be the goal to process as little input and as little output as possible. BMIs are currently very poor at processing information. Therefore, instead of receiving signals from all nanoparticles, for instance only particles whose neurons are activated could send data to a computer interface. Thus, 90% of the transmission capacity could be omitted. Furthermore, the Tangle is very sensitive in case of data storage. For example, today it takes a few hours just to upload a 1 MB picture to the Tangle. So also the output must be minimized. 

# Unity
Interoperatibility between BMIs is a key feature for Lights software to become a standard network for the internet of thoughts. Unity aims to develop software to be integrated in the Offline-Pro that makes it easier for BMIs from different manufacturers to communicate.

# PoUI
Proof of Unique Identity

# Matrix
The Matrix represents the decentralized network of the company, which will dilate the current Internet around the component of brains and will enable interactions and mergers between humans and machines, as well as several people. The Matrix will be represented by Matrix nodes, which will place processing power and storage at the disposal. Within MAMs, transferred and stored on the Tangle, generalized thoughts will be sent and received. This allows for every human, strong AI or even animal to transfer thoughts and in the far future experiences, emotions or other perceptions.

# Full Nodes
Full Nodes are required to store data from the Tangle and become a Matrix node. Full Nodes will become more important as the project progresses.

# Replicator
The reason that nanotechnology is not already dominating the global market is a manufacturing problem. In chemical reactions, nanoparticles are still produced under laboratory conditions, which costs a lot of money and a lot of time. Perhaps the most promising approach to designing replicators that can produce nanobots is to assemlbe them in a kinematic process. First proposed by John von Neumann and later described by Eric Drexler, an assemlber could assemble any moclecule in a mechanical process called mechanosynthesis. In contrast to chemosynthesis, mechanosynthesis allows for positioning specific atoms and can therefore produce any molecule, regardless of whether it is chemically reproducible or not. So it is possible to form completely new particles while also boosting assembly speed, efficiency, reliability and chemical purity as well as reducing the manufacturing costs.

# Fusion

Classified :trollface:

# VR & AR
In the future, a protocol for the generation of virtual and augmented environments will be implemented in Matrix nodes. As a result, the flow of information and bandwidth must be further expanded. So virtual worlds will only become possible in a few years to decades. In addition, many processes must be performed on users' computers to allow the environment to interact with their thoughts and perceptions.

# Mass Production
If the Replicator can be built, mechanosynthetic nanoparticle production can be distributed between private individuals and organizations so that every owner could potentially code new nanoparticles. This has to be done under the control of Light, but would still increase productivity. Also, Light could help IOTA producing trinary processors on nanoscale. 

# Connectome

# Inception
It's basically Inception

# Infinity
Ultimately it is Lights aim to make it possible to live as long as possible. <p>
(it's definitely not possible to live forever in this universe: https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2012-1.pdf)
Infinity is a project, with an unbelievable ambitious task. The result could be to upload a brain step by step and gain immortality (well nearly). We think Infinity can be achieved until 2050.

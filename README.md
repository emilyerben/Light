# Light


Light will be a project subdivided in three main sections corresponding to the fields 
1. Neuroscience combined with AI (code name: BrainX)
2. Nanotechnology (code name: Cynapse) <p>
and
3. Brain Networktechnology (code name: Matrix)
 

# Very Short Introduction <p>
  Light is intended as a privacy maintaining decentralized organization for brain-to-machine and brain-to-brain communication, counteracting the thread of Neurological Disorders, Artificial Intelligence and Death. We are looking forward to developing hardware and software, which can ultimately interact with the entire brain.

# Tangle
The Tangle is a directed acyclic graph specified in the IOTA-Foundations white paper http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf by Serguei Popov. It represents a contrasting multidimensional approach to the one-dimensional blockchain technology. The Tangle technology provides for a network in which each user has to confirm two parent transactions (tips) in order to make a transaction. Thus, the proof-of-work divided among miners does no longer exist. This also has the advantage of requiring less computing power and thereby eliminating the increasing environmental pollution from mining. While for Bitcoin, processing power steadily needs to increase and miners need to store a steadily growing amount of blockchain data, making Bitcoin increasingly unstable with growing user traffic, the Tangle is becoming increasingly secure as user numbers increase. The more transactions are processed, the more transactions are confirmed, the faster the network and the safer these transactions become. In addition, there are no fees, the Tangle is quantum-resistant, provides for offline transactions, has better protection against sybil- or other attacks and prevents storage overflow by snapshotting the network once in a while.

The Tangle, for all its advantages over other cryptocurrencies, shell become the basis of Light's Matrix network. The Tangle is a connection to the Internet of Everything. As long as a device is connected to the Tangle and confers the right to access it, anyone could telepathically control the device through the Matrix network. Light will work with many companies to ensure secure access to some features of their devices. Especially anonymity in the Matrix is important for Light, which is why the Tangles security will be coplemented by the Pro. The Tangle furthermore provides Flash Channels and MAMs, which allow for a particularly fast exchange of data.

# IoE
The Internet of Everything is slightly different from the Internet of Things, because it not only attempts to connect machines, but to connect humans and processes with machines. IOTA will enable the economy of things, whereas Light will play its part in connecting this economy of things to a economy of humans and real idenities. The Tangle is a door for Light to the Internet of Things and therefore to the IoE. To date there are a few but very ambitious partnerships and connections between the IOTA Foundation and mainstream companies (e.g. Volkswagen, Fujitsu, Bosch, BMW, Schindler Group, the UN, InnoEnergy, Kontakt.io, Ford, General Motors, IBM, SAP, Daimler, Phillips, Samsung, Microsoft, Porsche or Telekom). If products of these companies supported the Tangle, Light would also be able to access the products and thus could focus on other projects or help the IOTA Foundation with gaining partnerships. 

# Cynapse
Cynapse will develop the hardware for its network und software.

Cynapse is supposed to be the foundation for an error-free interaction between the human brain and the internet of everything. Cynapse will do research on Brain Machine Interfaces, which will use nanoparticles to increase the precision of mind reading. Light has an important decision to make regarding the moral viability of invasive methods that can analyze and interact with the brain. Currently, brain-computer interfaces are often used non-invasively, but as networking progresses, integrating technology into our brains will become inevitable. Therefore, Light will use highly invasive yet biologically safe nanoparticles to operate in the brain. Important functions for such nanoparticles are a harmless injection, interaction between brain and technology, an adequate energy supply, and signal transmission to a computer unit. So far there are few distriptions of micro- or nanotechnological brain-machine-interfaces and almost none for business purposes.

# Flash Channels
Flash channels are channels created between two parties in the network. These are established apart from the rest of the network and can now communicate or send money offline. Since no PoW must be provided within the Flash Channels, transactions can be sent at the speed of light. This is especially important for Light, as large amounts of data must be transferred in a very short time, as soon as two people or one person and one AI are talking to each other via thoughts. It might be difficult to imagine the use of Flash Channels if more than two people want to communicate. But since the Tangle is free of charge, eliminating routing, instead, one can open multiple Flash Channels simultaneously, creating a network between multiple communication partners. At the end of each communication, one would join the network again to save the transfered money on the Tangle.

# Link
Based on HTM theory (https://numenta.com/, https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/biological-and-machine-intelligence/BAMI-Complete.pdf) and other neurobiological models of the neocortex, Link will be a project that brings together Neurobiology, Distributed Ledger Technology and Machine Learning. The key technology of Link will be the Pro (Pattern Recognition Organizer), which will store decentralized identities and decrypt and encrypt thoughts.

# BMI
BMIs are nothing new and don't really need a detailed explanation. Companies that follow similar paths to Light are for example Neuralink, Kernel or Synchron.

# Qubic
In 2012, under the message of Come-from-Beyond on a project called Qubic, a forum was created that allowed some insights into the structure of the project. After the end of the forum, for many years there was no more accurate information about Qubic, but in 2018 the mystical Project Q was due to be released. Already after initial information on Qubic was available in May 2018, you could not overlook its brilliance and potential range of influence. In 2012, Qubic was merely an approach to a system that has been expanded to this day. It was already confirmed in May by the founders that it would enable Smart Contracts, Oracle and outsourced computing, which has many benefits for Light. For a decentralized network that wants to enable a virtual reality and an exchange of thoughts, smart contracts are extremely important. But Oracles could offer even greater potential. They connect APIs and thus the regular Internet with the decentralized system of Tangles. Oracles can therefore also allow access to the entire Internet for Light. The biggest potential, however, is outsourced computing. Decentralized outsourced computing could enable outsourcing of thoughts and thus the merging of intelligences. In addition, a computer in use today may not be able to handle all the thought streams of a NanoBMI on its own and thus may require computing power from other computers or devices. This is a possible approach and concept for the Pro.

# NanoBMI
This will be discussed in-depth in Light white paper on this topic. 
(Will probably be published in 2 to 3 years)

# MAM
IOTA uses a Gossip protocol for sending Masked Authenticated Messages (MAMs) that sends encrypted messages to Tangle. There, certain nodes receive the message and gossip it to other nodes. If you send messages in the so-called private mode, as long as a node does not know the root, i.e. the channel ID and the hash of the message, it can not read the message. If you are in restrictive mode, only nodes with a sidekey can access your data. So the Tangle allows for secure data transfer that Light will use, to send and store thoughts as well as information about a userâ€™s brain, which is needed for the PoUI. However, one must consider the principle of immutability of these messages. Even IPFS has the problem that files, once stored on its network, can not be removed from the Blockchain again. IOTA does not have this attribute to the same extent because so-called snapshotting and, in this very case, local snapshots can delete the messages again. On a high level, a snapshot of the Tangle aggregates all the transactions of a node into a single transaction, greatly reducing the amount of data on the entire Tangle. The MAMs that are sent before the snapshot disappear with it, which is even relatively positive for Light, because thoughts should not necessarily be stored eternally. Some thoughts might still be saved forever. All one needs is a connection to a Permanode, which still allows to capture data as long as possible. In the future, snapshots could be done locally, whereas today they affect the entire Tangle. Therefore, all messages can be deleted immediately after a call in the local Tangle, which would also be a positive feature.

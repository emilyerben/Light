# Light


Light will be a project subdivided in three main sections corresponding to the fields 
1. Neuroscience combined with AI (code name: BrainX)
2. Nanotechnology (code name: Cynapse) <p>
and
3. Brain Networktechnology (code name: Matrix)
 

# Very Short Introduction <p>
  Light is intended as a privacy maintaining decentralized organization for brain-to-machine and brain-to-brain communication, counteracting the thread of Neurological Disorders, Artificial Intelligence and Death. We are looking forward to developing hardware and software, which can ultimately interact with the entire brain.

# Tangle
The Tangle is a directed acyclic graph specified in the IOTA-Foundations white paper http://iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf by Serguei Popov. It represents a contrasting multidimensional approach to the one-dimensional blockchain technology. The Tangle technology provides for a network in which each user has to confirm two parent transactions (tips) in order to make a transaction. Thus, the proof-of-work divided among miners does no longer exist. This also has the advantage of requiring less computing power and thereby eliminating the increasing environmental pollution from mining. While for Bitcoin, processing power steadily needs to increase and miners need to store a steadily growing amount of blockchain data, making Bitcoin increasingly unstable with growing user traffic, the Tangle is becoming increasingly secure as user numbers increase. The more transactions are processed, the more transactions are confirmed, the faster the network and the safer these transactions become. In addition, there are no fees, the Tangle is quantum-resistant, provides for offline transactions, has better protection against sybil- or other attacks and prevents storage overflow by snapshotting the network once in a while.

The Tangle, for all its advantages over other cryptocurrencies, shell become the basis of Light's Matrix network. The Tangle is a connection to the Internet of Everything. As long as a device is connected to the Tangle and confers the right to access it, anyone could telepathically control the device through the Matrix network. Light will work with many companies to ensure secure access to some features of their devices. Especially anonymity in the Matrix is important for Light, which is why the Tangles security will be coplemented by the Pro. The Tangle furthermore provides Flash Channels and MAMs, which allow for a particularly fast exchange of data.
